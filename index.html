	This is the place where the things without stuff go.
		The bones without marrow,
		The feelings without taut.
	
	Motion dissolves in the endless description of infinity,
		and most of the aspects of life are realized.

	In the fiction of experience is found the tool of might,
		but not without paying the price of induction.
	
	Repetitiousness will appeal to many,
		but it is only in this place with the things without stuff
		that can finally rest the few.
